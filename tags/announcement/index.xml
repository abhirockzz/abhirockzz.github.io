        &lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello, folks! Delighted to announce that I recently joined the Cloud Developer Advocacy team at Microsoft 😃 😃&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was fortunate to have worked on developer platforms (PaaS and Serverless) during my stint as a Product Manager at Oracle with a focus on developer experience and advocacy — so I decided to convert this into a full-time role and glad to have joined a company which lays a huge emphasis on developer outreach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*YfUaB9cUqa6o1DmAlfVk4A.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;https://makeameme.org/meme/i-should-be-5b5bb0&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://makeameme.org/meme/i-should-be-5b5bb0&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://makeameme.org/meme/i-should-be-5b5bb0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am humbled and a little intimidated at the same time, to have joined this amazing team at Microsoft. You will realize that this feeling of being “&lt;em&gt;a little intimidated&lt;/em&gt;” is not without reason, once you take a look at the list below! There are some rock stars in there, but you know what — sometimes being the “dumbest person in the room” can be good for you 😉
&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/advocates/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microsoft Cloud Advocates&lt;/strong&gt;
*Our team&amp;rsquo;s charter is to help every technologist on the planet succeed, be they students or those working in…*developer.microsoft.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What will I be doing and what have I been up to so far?&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-will-i-be-doing-and-what-have-i-been-up-to-so-far&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-will-i-be-doing-and-what-have-i-been-up-to-so-far&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;TL;DR: a whole bunch of things, with a focus on developers and technical communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This includes (but not limited to) producing content in the form of code, blogs, demos, tutorials; run workshops and hackathon; engaging with you in-person at events, conferences, meetups, and (hopefully) much more. Also, I’ll be on the lookout for your feedback/inputs/pain-points and funnel them back to respective teams at Microsoft, such as engineering, PM, etc. (yes, this time I’ll be on the other side 😉). And, in case you were curious, some of the specific areas I’ll be focusing on include &lt;a href=&#34;https://azure.microsoft.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Azure&lt;/a&gt;, Kubernetes, Serverless, Go and Kafka — yeah I know, all the 🔥 🔥 stuff!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been a couple of weeks since I joined and things seem to be moving at a rapid pace. I have been busy with onboarding (obviously!), getting to know Microsoft (yeah it’s huge!), chatting with colleagues, teams and getting up to speed with things in general. In between all this, I already have a few talks lined up, got to be part of an interesting little project and kick-started a new blog series — stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interested in joining the team?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;interested-in-joining-the-team&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers! 😄&lt;/p&gt;
